computer vision using BYOL on MNIST dataset

Useful commands :
- make run : downloads the dataset if not already done, trains the model with the BYOL technique, fine-tunes it and evaluates the model by predicting outputs on unseen data.
- make dataset : only downloads the dataset if not already done.
- make train : only trains the model.
- make fine-tuning : only fine-tunes the model.
- make predict : only predicts outputs on unseen data.
